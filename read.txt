hey hi praneeth this side 
firstly i just want to say  
i used flask application to operatefrontend and backend 
and about gpt integration i used gpt4free repository from git hub :https://github.com/xtekky/gpt4free 
and as of now i am getting response of test cases by giving specific task 
example : by giving promt it gives the test cases as metioned in document with funtionlity 
1.air bnb login functionality as step-by-step guide on how to test each functionality. Each test case should include:
Description: What the test case is about.
Pre-conditions: What needs to be set up or ensured before testing.
Testing Steps: Clear, step-by-step instructions on how to perform the test.
Expected Result: What should happen if the feature works correctly.

 and i tryied to do photo integration but there i nave no credits in openai . if it available then i will done easyly but i got the alternative opensource but its requirement is 64gb of ram and 40 gb storage - advantage of using that open source llm model is we can use every llm present in the market example : cloud 3.5 , gpt 4 etc but the open source llm is more efficient than chat gpt and cluade sonnet 
1.and i try to do automate the process using selenium , playwrite but it taking time and there is a time limitation if there is any extention i would easyly done it but 
i have a mind set that if any task is incompleted i make sure i complete and learn the unknown skills . thanks for giving opportunity 
if there is any doubt don't hesitate to talks
